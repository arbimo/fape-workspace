This is simply to bootstrap a workspace for FAPE.
You need gws (https://streakycobra.github.io/gws/) and 
sbt (http://www.scala-sbt.org/)


You pull all needed repositories with 
$ gws update


Once you have them you can use sbt at the root of this repository.

$ sbt compile   # builds all subprojects
$ sbt pack   # generates executables in target/pack/bin
$ sbt "~ pack"  # rebuilds executables every time a source file changes
